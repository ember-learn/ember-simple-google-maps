# ember-simple-google-maps

Makes the Google Maps API available to a consuming application by supplying its external script to the Application's `index.html`.

Once the application starts, the user may interact with the Google maps API [as documented](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial).

## Customization

Aspects of the Google Maps Installation can be customized, by supplying environment variables to the server process.

* `GOOGLE_MAPS_URL` - The URL to the API script.  Defaults to `https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js`.
* `GOOGLE_MAPS_VERSION` - The version of the API script. Defaults to `3.31`.
* `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` - The Google Maps API Key.  Defaults to none, which is OK when running your server on localhost, but will require a key when deploying to a remote server.
